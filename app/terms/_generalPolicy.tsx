      <h4>1. Your Agreement</h4>
      <p>
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
        been the industry&apos;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer
        took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
        only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
        unchanged.
        <br />
        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
        passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
        versions of Lorem Ipsum.
